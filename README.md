### 👋 Hey, I'm **Abhishek Jaiswal**

🔥 Emotional Engineer • UI Tyrant • Full-Stack Madman  
Pixels obey me. Layouts fear me.  
I don’t design experiences — I craft obsessions.

---

### ⚡ What I Do

- 🎨 **UI/UX Tyranny:** Interfaces so emotional they might ghost you  
- 🤖 **AI Whispering:** I talk to AI like it's my intern. It listens.  
- 🔧 **Full-Stack Madness:** React, Tailwind, MongoDB, Node, Framer Motion  
- 🧠 **Emotional Engineering:** I design *feelings*, not features.

---

### 🥵 What Makes Me... Me?

- Probably screamed at a border-radius once  
- Treats `grid-gap` like a moral compass  
- Spends 4 hours perfecting 1px padding  
- Ships late — because “the vibes weren’t aligned”

---

### 💻 Live Portfolio

🌐 [**capturingthecore**](https://capturingthecore.me)  
> Beautiful chaos, pixel-pushed emotion, and handcrafted UI vibes.

---

### 🎯 Currently Working On

- `capturingthecore` — a creative studio for emotional web experiences  
- Custom Ghibli-style memory art, AI storytelling, and QR-coded feels

### 🧠 Philosophy

> _“I’m not here to disrupt — I’m here to build beautiful sh*t that makes people **feel**.”_
